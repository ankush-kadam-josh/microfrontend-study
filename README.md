no react here,
pure js and html with webpack to build and test the micro-front-ends

we are using webpack dev server to serve our app available to access in the browser


To start the application:
- start 3 applications in 3 different terminals:
- terminal1:
  cd cart
  npm install (if not done earlier)
  npm start
- terminal2:
  cd container
  npm install (if not done earlier)
  npm start
- terminal3:
  cd products
  npm install (if not done earlier)
  npm start
- (handle git from parent folder)

goto container url: localhost:8080 (main application)
if we want to run products project localhost:8081
if we want to run cart project localhost:8082
